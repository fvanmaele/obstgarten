\item{x_test}{data.frame: test data with labels of dimensions Number of Samples x Features + 1}

\item{m}{Count of random dimensions in random forest. Is set on heuristically motivated values if m is NULL}

\item{regression}{logical: specify whether tree is a decision (classification) or a
regression tree. default=TRUE, TRUE for regression, FALSE for classification}

\item{random_forest}{logical: TRUE: random forest, FALSE: bagging}

\item{quantile}{whether to use quantiles for computing the optimal
subdivision (\code{logical}, defaults to \code{FALSE})}

\item{q_threshold}{minimal of data points for using quantiles (\code{integer},
defaults to \code{100L})}

\item{q_pct}{amount of probabilities for \code{quantile()}, in pct. of the data
set size. (\code{numeric}, defaults to \code{0.25})}

\item{use_parallel:}{Whether to use parallel computation or not}

\value{
vector: of size Number of Samples containing bagged predictions to dataset
character vector for classification case and double vector for regression case

\description{
The boostrap aggregating (Bagging) procedure is an ensemble
method from statistical machine learning. It can reduce the
model's variance, enhance the accuracy and has a regularization
effect. The Bagging procedure adds randomness to the model
by averaging (regression) or majority-voting (classification)
the prediction for samples $x_i$ over the different models that
were fitted on the bootstrap samples. The bootstrap samples are
created by randomly drawing n samples from the dataset of size n
with replacement. The number of bootstrap samples B is a
hyperparameter of the model.

This method performs bagging on a data set and returns predictions.
